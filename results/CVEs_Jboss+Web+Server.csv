1,CVE-2016-5387,284,None,None,7/18/16,1/18/18,5.1,None,Remote,High,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an ""httpoxy"" issue.  NOTE: the vendor states ""This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387""; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability."
2,CVE-2016-4448,None,None,None,6/9/16,1/4/18,10,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Complete,Complete,Complete,Format string vulnerability in libxml2 before 2.9.4 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via format string specifiers in unknown vectors.
3,CVE-2016-2183,200,None,#NAME?,8/31/16,7/4/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,"The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a ""Sweet32"" attack."
