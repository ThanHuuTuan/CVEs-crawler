1,CVE-2017-1000247,20,None,None,2017-11-16,2017-12-04,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,Partial,None,British Columbia Institute of Technology CodeIgniter 3.1.3 is vulnerable to HTTP Header Injection in the set_status_header() common function under Apache resulting in HTTP Header Injection flaws.
2,CVE-2016-10131,74,None,Exec Code,2017-01-12,2017-03-15,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,system/libraries/Email.php in CodeIgniter before 3.1.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging control over the email->from field to insert sendmail command-line arguments.
3,CVE-2014-8686,310,None,None,2017-09-19,2017-09-28,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,CodeIgniter before 2.2.0 makes it easier for attackers to decode session cookies by leveraging fallback to a custom XOR-based encryption scheme when the Mcrypt extension for PHP is not available.
4,CVE-2014-8684,310,None,None,2017-09-19,2017-09-28,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,CodeIgniter before 3.0 and Kohana 3.2.3 and earlier and 3.3.x through 3.3.2 make it easier for remote attackers to spoof session cookies and consequently conduct PHP object injection attacks by leveraging use of standard string comparison operators to compare cryptographic hashes.
