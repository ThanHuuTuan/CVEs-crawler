1,CVE-2018-1333,399,None,DoS,2018-06-18,2018-08-21,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"By specially crafting HTTP/2 requests, workers would be allocated 60 seconds longer than necessary, leading to worker exhaustion and a denial of service. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.18-2.4.30,2.4.33)."
2,CVE-2018-1312,287,None,None,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection."
3,CVE-2018-1303,125,None,DoS,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability."
4,CVE-2018-1302,476,None,None,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,None,None,Partial,"When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk."
5,CVE-2018-1301,119,None,Overflow,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,None,None,Partial,"A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage."
6,CVE-2018-1283,20,None,None,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,3.5,None,Remote,Medium,Single system,None,Partial,None,"In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a ""Session"" header. This comes from the ""HTTP_SESSION"" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix ""HTTP_"" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications."
7,CVE-2017-15715,20,None,None,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename."
8,CVE-2017-15710,787,None,DoS,2018-03-26,2018-06-02,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all."
9,CVE-2017-9798,416,None,None,2017-09-18,2018-07-18,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,"Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c."
10,CVE-2017-9789,416,None,None,2017-07-13,2017-11-13,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"When under stress, closing many connections, the HTTP/2 handling code in Apache httpd 2.4.26 would sometimes access memory after it has been freed, resulting in potentially erratic behaviour."
11,CVE-2017-9788,20,None,DoS +Info,2017-07-13,2018-01-04,6.4,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,Partial,"In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service."
12,CVE-2017-7679,119,None,Overflow,2017-06-19,2018-06-02,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_mime can read one byte past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type response header."
13,CVE-2017-7668,20,None,None,2017-06-19,2018-06-02,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"The HTTP strict parsing changes added in Apache httpd 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value."
14,CVE-2017-7659,476,None,None,2017-07-26,2018-06-02,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"A maliciously constructed HTTP/2 request could cause mod_http2 2.4.24, 2.4.25 to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the server process."
15,CVE-2017-3169,476,None,None,2017-06-19,2018-06-02,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port."

17,CVE-2016-8743,19,None,Http R.Spl.,2017-07-27,2018-04-24,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,Partial,None,"Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution."
18,CVE-2016-8740,20,None,DoS,2016-12-05,2018-04-24,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"The mod_http2 module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.23, when the Protocols configuration includes h2 or h2c, does not restrict request-header length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2 request."

NOTE: the vendor states ""This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387""; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability."
