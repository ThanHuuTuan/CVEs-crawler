1,CVE-2018-12040,79,None,XSS,2018-06-13,2018-08-08,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,None,Partial,None,"** DISPUTED ** Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web profiler in SensioLabs Symfony 3.3.6 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the ""file"" parameter, aka an _profiler/open?file= URI.  NOTE: The vendor states ""The XSS ... is in the web profiler, a tool that should never be deployed in production (so, we don't handle those issues as security issues)."""
2,CVE-2018-11408,601,None,None,2018-06-13,2018-08-03,5.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,None,"The security handlers in the Security component in Symfony in 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11 have an Open redirect vulnerability when security.http_utils is inlined by a container.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-16652."
3,CVE-2018-11407,287,None,Bypass,2018-06-13,2018-08-03,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"An issue was discovered in the Ldap component in Symfony 2.8.x before 2.8.37, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.7, and 4.0.x before 4.0.7. It allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with a ""null"" password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated bind.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-2403."
4,CVE-2018-11406,352,None,CSRF,2018-06-13,2018-08-05,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"An issue was discovered in the Security component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11. By default, a user's session is invalidated when the user is logged out. This behavior can be disabled through the invalidate_session option. In this case, CSRF tokens were not erased during logout which allowed for CSRF token fixation."
5,CVE-2018-11386,613,None,DoS,2018-06-13,2018-08-05,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,None,None,Partial,"An issue was discovered in the HttpFoundation component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11. The PDOSessionHandler class allows storing sessions on a PDO connection. Under some configurations and with a well-crafted payload, it was possible to do a denial of service on a Symfony application without too much resources."
6,CVE-2018-11385,384,None,None,2018-06-13,2018-08-05,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"An issue was discovered in the Security component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11. A session fixation vulnerability within the ""Guard"" login feature may allow an attacker to impersonate a victim towards the web application if the session id value was previously known to the attacker."
7,CVE-2017-16652,601,None,None,2018-06-13,2018-08-08,5.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,None,"An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.38, 2.8.x before 2.8.31, 3.2.x before 3.2.14, and 3.3.x before 3.3.13. DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler or DefaultAuthenticationFailureHandler takes the content of the _target_path parameter and generates a redirect response, but no check is performed on the path, which could be an absolute URL to an external domain. This Open redirect vulnerability can be exploited for example to mount effective phishing attacks."
8,CVE-2016-4423,399,None,DoS,2016-06-01,2016-06-03,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"The attemptAuthentication function in Component/Security/Http/Firewall/UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener.php in Symfony before 2.3.41, 2.7.x before 2.7.13, 2.8.x before 2.8.6, and 3.0.x before 3.0.6 does not limit the length of a username stored in a session, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session storage consumption) via a series of authentication attempts with long, non-existent usernames."
9,CVE-2016-2403,287,None,Bypass,2017-02-07,2018-08-05,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"Symfony before 2.8.6 and 3.x before 3.0.6 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with an empty password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated bind."
10,CVE-2016-1902,310,None,None,2016-06-01,2016-06-03,5.0,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,"The nextBytes function in the SecureRandom class in Symfony before 2.3.37, 2.6.x before 2.6.13, and 2.7.x before 2.7.9 does not properly generate random numbers when used with PHP 5.x without the paragonie/random_compat library and the openssl_random_pseudo_bytes function fails, which makes it easier for attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors."
11,CVE-2015-8125,None,None,CSRF,2015-12-07,2016-12-07,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"Symfony 2.3.x before 2.3.35, 2.6.x before 2.6.12, and 2.7.x before 2.7.7 might allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a timing attack involving the (1) Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices or (2) Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/DigestAuthenticationListener class in the Symfony Security Component, or (3) legacy CSRF implementation from the Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Csrf/CsrfProvider/DefaultCsrfProvider class in the Symfony Form component."
12,CVE-2015-8124,None,None,None,2015-12-07,2016-12-07,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"Session fixation vulnerability in the ""Remember Me"" login feature in Symfony 2.3.x before 2.3.35, 2.6.x before 2.6.12, and 2.7.x before 2.7.7 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via a session id."
13,CVE-2015-4050,284,None,Bypass,2015-06-02,2016-12-30,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,None,Partial,None,"FragmentListener in the HttpKernel component in Symfony 2.3.19 through 2.3.28, 2.4.9 through 2.4.10, 2.5.4 through 2.5.11, and 2.6.0 through 2.6.7, when ESI or SSI support enabled, does not check if the _controller attribute is set, which allows remote attackers to bypass URL signing and security rules by including (1) no hash or (2) an invalid hash in a request to /_fragment."
14,CVE-2015-2308,94,None,Exec Code,2015-06-24,2016-12-02,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"Eval injection vulnerability in the HttpCache class in HttpKernel in Symfony 2.x before 2.3.27, 2.4.x and 2.5.x before 2.5.11, and 2.6.x before 2.6.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a language=""php"" attribute of a SCRIPT element."
