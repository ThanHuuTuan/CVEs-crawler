1,CVE-2018-8014,254,None,None,5/16/18,8/17/18,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"The defaults settings for the CORS filter provided in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.8, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, 7.0.41 to 7.0.88 are insecure and enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. It is expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore, it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue."
2,CVE-2018-1305,284,None,None,2/23/18,8/29/18,4,None,Remote,Low,Single system,Partial,None,None,"Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them."
3,CVE-2018-1304,254,None,None,2/28/18,8/29/18,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,None,None,"The URL pattern of """" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected."
4,CVE-2017-15706,358,None,None,1/31/18,5/31/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,Partial,None,"As part of the fix for bug 61201, the documentation for Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M22 to 9.0.1, 8.5.16 to 8.5.23, 8.0.45 to 8.0.47 and 7.0.79 to 7.0.82 included an updated description of the search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. The update was not correct. As a result, some scripts may have failed to execute as expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly. Note that the behaviour of the CGI servlet has remained unchanged in this regard. It is only the documentation of the behaviour that was wrong and has been corrected."
5,CVE-2017-12617,434,None,Exec Code,10/3/17,7/18/18,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"When running Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0, 8.5.0 to 8.5.22, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.46 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.81 with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server."
6,CVE-2017-12616,200,None,Bypass +Info,9/19/17,6/28/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,When using a VirtualDirContext with Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.80 it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs for resources served by the VirtualDirContext using a specially crafted request.
7,CVE-2017-12615,434,None,Exec Code,9/19/17,3/8/18,6.8,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.
8,CVE-2017-7675,22,None,Dir. Trav. Bypass,8/10/17,6/15/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.15 bypassed a number of security checks that prevented directory traversal attacks. It was therefore possible to bypass security constraints using a specially crafted URL.
9,CVE-2017-7674,345,None,None,8/10/17,6/28/18,4.3,None,Remote,Medium,Not required,None,Partial,None,"The CORS Filter in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21, 8.5.0 to 8.5.15, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.44 and 7.0.41 to 7.0.78 did not add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin. This permitted client and server side cache poisoning in some circumstances."
10,CVE-2017-6056,19,None,DoS,2/17/17,8/1/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,It was discovered that a programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an infinite loop. The denial of service is easily achievable as a consequence of backporting a CVE-2016-6816 fix but not backporting the fix for Tomcat bug 57544. Distributions affected by this backporting issue include Debian (before 7.0.56-3+deb8u8 and 8.0.14-1+deb8u7 in jessie) and Ubuntu.
11,CVE-2017-5664,254,None,None,6/6/17,7/18/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,Partial,None,"The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that, when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to 8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method. (2) By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method."
12,CVE-2017-5651,19,None,None,4/17/17,6/15/18,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,"In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the refactoring of the HTTP connectors introduced a regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors and/or response mix-up."
13,CVE-2017-5650,399,None,None,4/17/17,6/15/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads."
14,CVE-2017-5648,284,None,None,4/17/17,6/15/18,6.4,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,None,"While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to application listeners in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.11, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.75 did not use the appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application."
15,CVE-2017-5647,200,None,#NAME?,4/17/17,6/15/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,"A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18, 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42, 7.0.0 to 7.0.76, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.52, when send file was used, results in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the response for request C for request B and no response for request C."

18,CVE-2016-8747,200,None,#NAME?,3/14/17,6/15/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,An information disclosure issue was discovered in Apache Tomcat 8.5.7 to 8.5.9 and 9.0.0.M11 to 9.0.0.M15 in reverse-proxy configurations. Http11InputBuffer.java allows remote attackers to read data that was intended to be associated with a different request.
19,CVE-2016-8745,388,None,#NAME?,8/10/17,6/8/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,None,None,"A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions."

The issue exists because this listener wasn't updated for consistency with the CVE-2016-3427 Oracle patch that affected credential types."
21,CVE-2016-6817,119,None,DoS Overflow,8/10/17,6/8/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,The HTTP/2 header parser in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M11 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.6 entered an infinite loop if a header was received that was larger than the available buffer. This made a denial of service attack possible.

This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own."
