2,CVE-2016-4450,None,None,DoS,6/7/16,1/4/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"os/unix/ngx_files.c in nginx before 1.10.1 and 1.11.x before 1.11.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and worker process crash) via a crafted request, involving writing a client request body to a temporary file."
3,CVE-2016-1247,59,None,#NAME?,11/29/16,2/23/17,7.2,Admin,Local,Low,Not required,Complete,Complete,Complete,"The nginx package before 1.6.2-5+deb8u3 on Debian jessie, the nginx packages before 1.4.6-1ubuntu3.6 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, before 1.10.0-0ubuntu0.16.04.3 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and before 1.10.1-0ubuntu1.1 on Ubuntu 16.10, and the nginx ebuild before 1.10.2-r3 on Gentoo allow local users with access to the web server user account to gain root privileges via a symlink attack on the error log."
4,CVE-2016-0747,399,None,DoS,2/15/16,1/4/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,"The resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not properly limit CNAME resolution, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker process resource consumption) via vectors related to arbitrary name resolution."
5,CVE-2016-0746,None,None,DoS,2/15/16,3/22/18,7.5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,Partial,Partial,Partial,Use-after-free vulnerability in the resolver in nginx 0.6.18 through 1.8.0 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker process crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted DNS response related to CNAME response processing.
6,CVE-2016-0742,None,None,DoS,2/15/16,1/4/18,5,None,Remote,Low,Not required,None,None,Partial,The resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and worker process crash) via a crafted UDP DNS response.
